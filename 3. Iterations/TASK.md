#Task

Given an integer n, calculate for all values from 0 -> n :

1. n factorial
2. The nth Fibonacci number
3. PI to n decimal places

Display to std out.

Notes :
 - Turns out Leibniz series for PI converges very slowly. It takes 1bn iterations just to get 10dps!
 - How do we know correct to n dps? Assume correct if doesn't change in next iteration. (While I won't do a mathematical proof, this is a valid assumption for the Leibniz convergence.)
