#Task

1. Given an integer n, calculate for all values from 0 -> n both n factorial and the nth Fibonacci number.
2. Calculate PI correct to n decimal places using Leibniz series*.
3. Calculate PI correct to n decimal places using Monty Carlo method.

Bonus : How efficiently can either solution calculate PI to 10 decimal places ?

Notes :
 - How do we know correct to n dps?
 - *Assume correct if doesn't change in next iteration. (While I won't do a mathematical proof, this is a valid assumption for the Leibniz convergence.)
