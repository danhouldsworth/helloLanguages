#Task

Create an image with three primative shapes : a red triangle, a blue square and a green circle. Display them via :

1. Create and save as a .png
2. Display on the screen **

** Note : I'm guessing that possibly the most practicle route for live (ie real-time or animated) graphics display may well be a front end of Browser/Canvas/WebSockets with the backend language (eg Go / Haskell / Node) providing the information over the WebSocket. The motivation for this task is mainly to settle this hypothesis.
