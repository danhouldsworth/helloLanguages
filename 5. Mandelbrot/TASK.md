#Task

1. Verify that a good estimate of the area of the Mandlebrot set is 1.51 (to 2 dp's)
2. Display the Mandlebrot set using a 20x20 grid of text of suitable characters (such as '.','o','O','@','*' for increaseing dwell time)
3. Animate the display showing a rotating view (use backspace to keep std out clean)

Bonus. Use optimisation techniques to complete #1 as fast as possible.
