#Task

Each time, display to std out both variables ```name``` and ```age```, capitalising ```name``` and converting ```age``` to months :

1. Take two arguments from the command line assuming in the order of ```name``` ```age```
2. Declare ```name``` ```age``` in a library program file
3. Access ```name``` ```age``` from the specified file ```data.json```
4. Ask the user to enter first ```name``` and then ```age```

Bonus Q : Provide informative errors if input for all of 1-4 is not the correct type.
Reading : Research any 3rd party libraries for each language that enable command line arguments (--options, -o etc)
