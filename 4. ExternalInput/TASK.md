#Task

Each time, read both variables ```name``` and ```age```, capitalising ```name``` and converting ```age``` to months :

1. Take two arguments from the command line assuming in the order of ```name``` ```age```
2. Declare ```name``` ```age``` in a library program file
3. Access ```name``` ```age``` from the specified file ```config.json```
4. Ask the user to enter first ```name``` and then ```age```

Bonus : Consider what would be an appropriate implementation of error handling?
