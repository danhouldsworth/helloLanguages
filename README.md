# helloLanguages
A problem oriented approach as I explore and learn programming languages

# Background
I tend to have a set approach as I learn a new language that goes along the lines of 'Hello, world!' to get going, then into factorial for basic functions and recursion, and then finally a mandlebrot set for a taster of architecting and displaying a reasonable size task.
I may then move onto a file/socket server, or even a particle simulator to encourage me to explore the nuances of the language more deeply.

# Problem
However, I frequently realise that I've forgortten much of what I learned, and when I go back to my files for a refresher, each stage has morphed into the next more complex task, and the original 'Hello, World!' is now a fully feldged Telnet server in Go, or a particle simulator in Javascript, or a Mandlebrot set area calculator in ARM assembly...!
None of which are useful as quick reminders.

# Brief
This time, I plan to orient the learning by the task itself. Tackling each challenge with as many languages as I have an appetite for, and ideally exploiting the particular capabilities and paradigms of each language to find the most elegant solution.

# Aim
I'm hopeful of three things to come out of this:

1. A quick revision of all the languages I've previously dabbled with : javascript, Go, C, ARM assembly
2. Provide a convenient, resiliant and growing framework for me to engage with new languages I'm interested in : Haskell, Rust, Prologue...
3. Develope an appreciation for the contrasting paradigms of each language.

# Structure
* Files stored within challenge project folders.
* Filename suffix will make langauge clear, filename should be name of challenge.
* Folder names prefixed with numbers to enable easy view of increasing difficulty
