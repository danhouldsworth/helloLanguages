#Task

1. Given an integer n, calculate for all values from 0 -> n both n factorial and the nth Fibonacci number.
2. Calculate PI correct to n decimal places* using Leibniz series.
3. Calculate PI correct to n decimal places* using Monty Carlo method.
Towers of Hanoi : Print out the moves required to solve the towers of hanoi with n rings.
Fizz Buzz : Printing 1-100 replace with Fizz if divisible by 3, Buzz if divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz if by both.
Birthday Party : How many people do you need to have at least 50% chance of a shared birthday?

Bonus : How efficiently can either solution calculate PI for n = 10 ?

Notes :
 - * How do we know correct to n dps? Assume correct if doesn't change in next iteration.
