#Task

1. Print the string 'Hello, world!' in reverse, then uppercase, then lower case.
2. Print the collection of strings made up by increasing subsets.
3. Take two strings 'Hello' and 'world'. First swap them, then copy the first over the second.

Bonus : What happens if the string is in Chinese? How is the string stored? What does it mean to look at, say, the 5th element of the string?
